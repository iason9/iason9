### Hi there, I'm iason 👋
- 🙎🏻‍♂️ About Me :  i have been interested in programming since 2013 but never really started doing code and focussing all my energy in code until 2018 that's when i really started practicing in real-world applications and making web apps, it was on that same year that i got my first remote web developer job.

- 📖  I’m currently learning everything because there is never enough of information, the more you learn the quickest you realize it 
- 👯  I’m looking to collaborate with other web developers and in EddieHubCommunity.
- 🥅 2021 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects, keep learning in all aspects of life, not just Code, in other words, keep evolving and be all i can be.
